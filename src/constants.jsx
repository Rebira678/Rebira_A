    choice: 'Tauri was chosen to leverage Rust performance for heavy local computation while maintaining a web-based UX.',
    tags: ['Rust', 'Tauri', 'Chrome API', 'React'],
    longDescription: 'RebikGuard is a security-focused tool designed for real-time traffic analysis and local data sanitization. By offloading heavy computation to a Rust-based Tauri host, the browser extension remains lightweight and performant. This project involved deep learning models for anomaly detection implemented locally for maximum privacy. It implements a secure bridge between browser-level events and system-level processing.',

    tags: ['MERN', 'Zustand', 'PDFKit', 'Node.js'],
    longDescription: 'TradeDraft optimizes the workflow for independent contractors in the construction and renovation space. It handles client management, dynamic quote generation, and legally binding work agreements. The platform uses a high-velocity dashboard built with React and Zustand for state management, ensuring that even on low-bandwidth connections, the UI feels instantaneous.',

    choice: 'Used a repository pattern to decouple the persistent layer, allowing for pluggable database backends.',
    tags: ['Express', 'MongoDB', 'Docker', 'Clean Arch'],
    longDescription: 'A robust task management system that focuses on persistence consistency and atomic operations. Designed for high-concurrency environments using Node.js and MongoDB. It features a complete CI/CD pipeline integrated with Docker, ensuring that deployments are predictable and rollbacks are instantaneous. The separation of concerns here allows for 99% logic test coverage.',
